## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
b <- mtcars %>% bind_cols(test="a")
b[1, "test"] <- "a^b^"
b %>% flextable() %>% autofit() %>% footnote(
  i = 1,
  j = 1:2,
  value = as_paragraph(c(
    "This is footnote one")),
  ref_symbols = c("a"),
  part = "body"
)

b
```
