## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, results='asis'}
b <- mtcars %>% bind_cols(test="a")
b[1, "test"] <- "a^b^"
b %>% kbl(format="latex", longtable = T, booktabs = T, linesep = "") %>% kable_styling() %>%  footnote(alphabet = c("test", "yo")) %>% pack_rows(index=c(" " = 0, "Group 1" = 4, "Group 2" = 2))
```
